**Two positions coming!** to work on marine contagious cancers. In 2025, I'll be starting a small group at the [Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology](https://www.mpi-bremen.de/en/Home.html) (Bremen, Germany) with the [Minerva Fast Track Fellowship](https://www.mpg.de/21667923/minerva-fast-track-programme)
