**ðŸš€ Two Positions Coming Soon!**
I am excited to share that Iâ€™ve just started leading a small group at the [Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology](https://mpi-bremen.de/en/Welcome-to-Alicia-Bruzos.html) in Bremen, Germany, supported by the [Minerva Fast Track Fellowship](https://www.mpg.de/21667923/minerva-fast-track-programme).
  
Over the next few months, I will be recruiting for two positions:
* **Postdoctoral Researcher in Bioinformatics** for 2 years with the possibility of extension: [Postdoc call 25/1](
https://ALBruzos.github.io/files/recruitment/2025_Postdoc_JobPositionOffer_BruzosLab-MPIMM_v2.pdf) - [Apply here before 16 November 2025](https://career.mpi-bremen.de/jobposting/a5697cec59a833bded496aa2af72837c6877acc60)
* **PhD Student**: [PhD student call 25/2](https://ALBruzos.github.io/files/recruitment/2025_PhDstudent_JobPositionOffer_BruzosLab-MPIMM_v2.pdf) - [Apply here before 16 November 2025](https://career.mpi-bremen.de/jobposting/fd71854ae887707f586dfa0d24e9a18a6d2225e60)
  
Our group is part of the Symbiosis Department and will study marine contagious cancers, a fascinating and emerging field at the intersection of cancer biology, hostâ€“pathogen interactions, and marine ecology.

If you are curious, motivated, and interested in joining us, please feel free to reach out, Iâ€™d love to hear from you! For the applications, I can only accept them through the official Max Planck recruiting platform of the links included above.
