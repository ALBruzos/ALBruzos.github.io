**ðŸš€ Two Positions Coming Soon!**
I am excited to share that Iâ€™ve just started leading a small group at the [Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology](https://mpi-bremen.de/en/Welcome-to-Alicia-Bruzos.html) in Bremen, Germany, supported by the [Minerva Fast Track Fellowship](https://www.mpg.de/21667923/minerva-fast-track-programme).
  
Over the next few months, I will be recruiting for two positions:
* Postdoctoral Researcher
* PhD Student
  
Our group is part of the Symbiosis Department and will study marine contagious cancers, a fascinating and emerging field at the intersection of cancer biology, hostâ€“pathogen interactions, and marine ecology.

If you are curious, motivated, and interested in joining us, please feel free to reach out, Iâ€™d love to hear from you!
