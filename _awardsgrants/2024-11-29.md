In November 2024, I travelled to Chile as part of the **FOVI Project (FOVI230047)**, where I combined **research activities, and teaching to master and bachelor students**.

### Research at IFOP Puerto Montt  
Together with colleagues from the **Instituto de Fomento Pesquero (IFOP)**, we carried out field and laboratory work aimed at detecting **hemic neoplasia in marine bivalves**. Target species included *Mytilus chilensis* (chorito), *Aulacomya atra* (cholga), *Tagelus dombeii* (navajuelas), *Gari solida* (almeja culengue), and *Ameghinomya antiqua* (almeja taca). Sampling took place in **Pelluhuin (Puerto Montt)** and **CaicaÃ©n channel (Calbuco)**, selected for their contrasting aquaculture activities and historical records of bivalve cancer.  

On **19 November 2024**, we also organized a **colloquium at IFOP Puerto Montt**, attended by researchers and aquaculture companies, to present the FOVI project results and foster regional collaborations.

### Teaching in Rancagua (Universidad de Oâ€™Higgins)  
I also carried out **teaching activities** within two courses:  
- *Sistemas AcuÃ¡ticos* (BSc in Environmental Sciences).  
- *Climate Change and Anthropogenic Pressures* (MSc in Environmental and Earth Sciences).  

In total, I taught **7.5 hours** combining theoretical and practical sessions. Students attended a seminar on **marine transmissible cancers** and participated in the **SEA Game: Search, Explore and Apply**, a gamified teaching tool designed to foster active learning and interdisciplinarity.  

In the *Sistemas AcuÃ¡ticos* course, I also led a practical session where students performed **hemolymph extractions, microscopic observations, and dissections of marine bivalves**, acquiring essential technical skills for their training as environmental scientists.

### International Symposium in San Fernando  
Finally, I was invited as a **speaker at the International Symposium hosted by the Universidad de Oâ€™Higgins (San Fernando, Chile)**, which marked the conclusion of the FOVI Project, coordinated by **Dr. Morgane Derrien**.  

This event brought together colleagues from Latin America and Europe, and provided an excellent platform to exchange perspectives, strengthen collaborations, and outline future projects.
