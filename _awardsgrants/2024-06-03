Chilean researchers from Universidad de O'Higgins and Instituto de Fomento Pesquero are these days visiting BOREA laboratory at UniversitÃ© de Caen Normandie thanks to a #FOVI project funded by ANID (Gobierno de Chile). What an honour to be part of this amazing initiative and Iâ€™m looking forward to travel to Chile ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± later this year!
