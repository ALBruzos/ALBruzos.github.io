Join us
=======
We welcome **enthusiastic and collaborative researchers** to join our team!  
Our group currently includes MSc and PhD students and postdoctoral researchers. We are still growing, which means a close, supportive, and interactive environment where everyoneâ€™s ideas matter. We are part of the **Symbiosis Department**, and we meet weekly to share updates, discuss progress, and exchange feedback on ongoing projects.

### STUDENT INTERNSHIPS (BSc, MSc, Erasmus)
We offer research internships for students interested in gaining hands-on experience in molecular biology, histology, bioinformatics, or field sampling.  
Interns contribute to ongoing projects while learning techniques and analytical approaches relevant to their studies.

---

### PHD STUDENTS
PhD positions are offered when funding is available, typically linked to specific funded research projects.  
Open positions will be announced broadly through our website and institutional channels. [Follow us in social media](https://albruzos.github.io/contact/)

### VISITING PHD FELLOWS
We host PhD students from other universities who wish to join us for short research stays or collaborative projects.  
If you are interested in spending a few months in our lab, feel free to reach out to discuss potential collaborations.

---

### POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS
We have experience with MSCA and other European national funding programs and are happy to support researchers interested in applying for fellowships to join our group.  
Whenever postdoctoral fully-funded positions become available, they will be widely advertised through this page and our institutional networks.
