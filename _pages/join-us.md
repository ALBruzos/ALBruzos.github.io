Join us
We welcome enthusiastic and collaborative researchers!
Our research group consists of MSc and PhD students and postdocs, and we always welcome international researchers. For the moment we are starting so we are a small team with more opportunties to get to know each other. We are part of the Symbiosis department and once a week we all meet to keep progress of the work.

STUDENT INTERNSHIP (BSc, MSc, Erasmus)
We welcome students who would like to stay with us to learn new techniques and procedures while giving us a hand in developing our research.

PHD STUDENT
We offer PhD contracts when funding is available, usually linked to already funded projects. We will broadly advertise any time a position is available.

PHD VISITING FELLOW
We welcome PhD students from other universities and countries, who want to join us for a few months and collaborate in ongoing research activities. 

POSTDOC
We have experience with MSCA and other European funding programs and are open to help researchers to get grants that will enable them to join our group. We will broadly advertise any time a position is available.
