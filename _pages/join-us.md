**We welcome enthusiastic and collaborative researchers to join our team!**  
    
Our group currently includes MSc and PhD students and postdoctoral researchers. We are still growing, which means a close, supportive, and interactive environment where everyoneâ€™s ideas matter. We are part of the **Symbiosis Department**, and we meet weekly to share updates, discuss progress, and exchange feedback on ongoing projects.  

### <FONT COLOR="#b3455b">STUDENT INTERNSHIPS (BSc, MSc, Erasmus)</FONT>
We offer research internships for students interested in gaining hands-on experience in molecular biology, histology, bioinformatics, or field sampling. Interns contribute to ongoing projects while learning techniques and analytical approaches relevant to their studies.

### <FONT COLOR="#4592b3">PHD STUDENTS</FONT>
PhD positions are offered when funding is available, typically linked to specific funded research projects. Open positions will be announced broadly through our website and institutional channels. [Follow us in social media](https://albruzos.github.io/contact/)  

### <FONT COLOR="#b3455b">VISITING FELLOWS</FONT>
We host PhD students from other universities who wish to join us for short research stays or collaborative projects. If you are interested in spending a few months in our lab, feel free to [reach out](https://albruzos.github.io/contact/) to discuss potential collaborations.

### <FONT COLOR="#4592b3">POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS</FONT>
We have experience with MSCA and other European national funding programs and are happy to support researchers interested in applying for fellowships to join our group. Whenever postdoctoral fully-funded positions become available, they will be widely advertised through this page and our institutional networks.
