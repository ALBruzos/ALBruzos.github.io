## Peer-review
My scientific expertise has led me to several invitations to take part in the peer-review system that ensures the rigorous standards of the scientific process. In particular, I have reviewed articles for the following journals:  
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>1 Science. IF(2021)=63.8</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>1 Science Advances. IF(2021)=14.9</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>1 Wiley Molecular Ecology. IF(2022)=6.2 </li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>1 Proceedings of the Royal Society B - Biological Sciences. IF(2022)=5.5 </li>
</ul>

All stated reviews have been certified by Publons / Web of Science: [D-7235-2018](https://publons.com/researcher/1404866/alicia-l-bruzos/).
