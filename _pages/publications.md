## Publications 
I’ve been fortunate to have worked on several international and interesting research projects in the field of *cancer genomics*. Keep an eye on the space below to see the list of publications my work has contributed to (hopefully!) grow the knowledge of the field...

## Peer-reviewing activity
My scientific expertise has led me to several invitations to take part in the peer-review system that ensures the rigorous standards of the scientific process. In particular, I have reviewed articles for the following journals:  
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>1 for <i>Science (AAAS)</i>. IF(2021)=56.9, JCR rank (2022) 2/73 (D1)</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>1 for <i>Science Advances (AAAS)</i>. IF(2021)=13.6, JCR rank (2022) 7/73 (D1)</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>1 for <i>Molecular Ecology (Wiley)</i>. IF(2022)=4.9, JCR rank (2022) 8/52 (Q1) </li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>1 for <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society B - Biological Sciences</i>. IF(2022)=4.7, JCR rank (2022) 10/52 (Q1)</li>
</ul>

All stated reviews have been certified by Publons / Web of Science: [D-7235-2018](https://publons.com/researcher/1404866/alicia-l-bruzos/).
