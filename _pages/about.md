Postdoctoral researcher currently working at [The Francis Crick Institute](https://www.crick.ac.uk/) and the [University College of London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/)(UK) in the laboratory of _Mosaicism and Precision Medicine_. Former doctoral student in _Molecular Medicine_ and Teaching Assistant of _Genetics_ at [University of Santiago de Compostela](https://www.usc.es/gl) (Spain).  

I graduated in 2015 in _Biological Sciences_ from the [University of Santiago de Compostela](https://www.usc.es/gl) (Spain)  completing my degree thesis with honors. Then, I specialized in _Bioinformatics_ at the [Autonomous University of Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/en/) (Spain) and during my master thesis I got involved the international [The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG)](https://dcc.icgc.org/pcawg) study. Later, I obtained a national doctoral fellowship to study metastasis and contagious cancers in the framework of the ERC-funded [Scuba Cancers](http://www.scubacancers.org/) project and I did three stays in international research institutions (USA, Ireland and South Korea).  

**My field of expertise is cancer genomics and contagious metastasis with high-impact publications in the multidisciplinary journals of _Nature_, _Nature Genetics_ and _Nature Communications_.**  

I truly believe in work/play balance and thatâ€™s what I try hard to achieve. I love travelling everywhere and anywhere because it teaches you things that are not in the books and you never expect to learn; actually, I had visited more countries than years old I am. As I cannot be travelling all the time, during my spare time, I enjoy watching films and series or hiking with my friends and my dog Murphy. I am both a mountain and sea lover.  

**Personal interests:** `Photography` | `Travelling` | `Movies` | `Tea` | `Graphical Design` | `Surf & Dive` | `Music` | `Science` | `Cultural Exchange` | `Nature` | `Gastronomy` |  `Hiking`  
`W` `A` `N` `D` `E` `R` `L` `U` `S` `T` - `S` `O` `U` `L`  

As we are living at a time when environmental (climate change, species extinction, deforestation...) and social issues (poverty, inequality...) are on the agenda every day, I often volunteer in NGOs trying to help change and let those who will come a better world.
