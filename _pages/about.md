Alicia L. Bruzos (born 29 March 1993) is a Spanish biologist and bioinformatician specialised in cancer genomics and marine contagious metastases. She is currently a postdoctoral researcher currently working at [The Francis Crick Institute](https://www.crick.ac.uk/) and the [University College of London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) (UK) in the laboratory of _Mosaicism and Precision Medicine_. She holds a PhD in Molecular Medicine in which she studied the genetic causes of contagious cancers affecting marine clams and cockles. Her work has been cited more than 1,200 times, published in the renowned scientific journal of Nature and awarded three times. She has been teaching genetics in public universities from Vigo, Santiago de Compostela and London since 2017 and out of the classroom she is committed to bringing science to society, which is evidenced by short-videos, visits to schools and institutes, outreach and editorial articles and talks in initiatives such as *Pint of Science*. &#8594; [See my CV](https://albruzos.github.io/cv/)

**My field of expertise is cancer genomics and contagious metastasis with high-impact publications in the multidisciplinary journals of _Nature_, _Nature Genetics_ and _Nature Communications_.** I have been involved in the international [Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG)](https://dcc.icgc.org/pcawg) study and the ERC-funded [Scuba Cancers](http://www.scubacancers.org/) project and currently working on the 100,000 Genomes Project of [Genomics England](https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/). &#8594; [Check my publication record](https://albruzos.github.io/publications/)

Alicia is a curious mind who enjoys exploring the unknown and probably that's why I chosen science as my proffesional career and travelling as my favourite hobbie. When I was young I set a goal: to visit as many foreign countries as years old I would be and for the moment, I haven't failed myself. &#8594; [Read my biography](https://albruzos.github.io/biography/) Alicia has travelled to 30+ countries on 4 continents, worked in laboratories worldwide, from Belgium, to the US to Ireland and even in South Korea, and she fluently speaks four languages. A travel junkie keen to combine the science with her insights from around the world, Alicia has accomplished her involvement in projects and activities that merge these two such as Sea Women Expeditions. A fierce supporter of women who travel, Alicia did her first solo female backpack travel in 2016 and since then, she encourages anyone that hesitates on undertaking a solo trip. She’s also gone on hitchhiking trips and long- distance hiking routes, in fact, she undertook the way of Santiago twice and, every summer, she organizes a hiking weekend for a ~10 people group in which they sleep in the forest with no tent. However, she has forever been fascinated by the sea, she grew up in a coastal town and that’s why she can easily be found scuba diving, sailing, or just having a walk with her feet in the water.

Alicia is grateful to all the women that fought for the rights that allow her to have the freedom of doing unthinkable things for women in the past such as being the Scientific Director of this patch mission expedition in 2022 and she feels tremendously lucky to have a feminist mother that showed her that a woman can do whatever she wants. In fact, family and friends play an important role in Alicia’s life, and her dog Murphy keeps her running towards her goals with its adventurous spirit and zest for life. 
My future plans include exploration of cancer in marine animals and help to break the ceiling glass in science. The sea hides many secrets and one day I will set up a laboratory to help humanity discover the well-kept secrets of cancer that marine species (much older than us) might tell us.

<!--
I love science but truly believe in work/play balance and that’s what I try hard to achieve. I also love travelling everywhere and anywhere and, in fact, I have visited more countries than years old I am. As I cannot be travelling all the time, I enjoy watching series or hiking with my friends and my dog Murphy during my spare time. I am both a mountain and sea soul.  
As we are living at a time when environmental (climate change, species extinction, deforestation...) and social issues (poverty, inequality...) are on the agenda every day, I often volunteer in NGOs trying to help change and let those who will come a better world.
