## What is it a contagious cancer?
Cancer occurs when a single cell in the body acquires genetic changes that drive inappropriate cell proliferation. Once initiated, cancer evolves by natural selection, often producing cell lineages that spread through the host by a process called metastasis ([Murchison EP, 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18455)). However, cancer does not normally spread beyond the host's body.

A *contagious cancer* or *clonal transmissible cancer*


## What cases have been reported in nature?

In some species, cancer cells can be directly transmitted between individuals.

## An ecological threat!
Some marine contagious cancers can even cross the species barrier, check the case of clam species from Southern Europe:
