## What is it a contagious cancer?
Cancer occurs when a single cell in the body acquires genetic changes that drive inappropriate cell proliferation. Once initiated, cancer evolves by natural selection, often producing cell lineages that spread through the host by a process called metastasis ([Murchison EP, 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18455)). However, cancer does not normally spread beyond the host's body.

A *contagious cancer* or *clonal transmissible cancer* is spread directly by the transfer of cells between individuals.

## Are they caused by a virus or pathogen?
No. Some tumors are induced by infectious agents such as viruses, and though these agents can be contagious, each tumor still arises in the infected *individual by transformation of somatic cells* ([Metzger MJ, 2015](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)00243-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867415002433%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#secsectitle0025)). In contagious cancer cases, a tumor cell itself naturally spreads among individuals as a transmissible cell line.  

## What cases have been reported in nature?
Contagious cancers are known to occur in dogs (CTVT), Tasmanian devils (DFTD), and several marine bivalves (BTN).

## An ecological threat!
Some marine contagious cancers can even cross the species barrier, check the case of cancer contagion between clam species in the Seas of Southern Europe:
