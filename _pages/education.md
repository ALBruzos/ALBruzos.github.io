### Education

**PhD. in Molecular Medicine**, Universidade de Santiago de Compostela: [CiMUS](https://www.usc.es/cimus/en) institute, Spain.  
:   *2016 – 2022* <sup>expected</sup>  
:   Specialization in Cancer.  
:   Title of Doctoral Thesis: _"Evolution of bivalve transmissible cancers"_  

[TFM]: ## "Retrotransposons are repetitive elements that are constantly on the move. They copy and insert themselves at new sites in the host genome generating structural variability of potential functional importance for the cancer cell. In this master thesis, we catalogued the full set of L1 germline elements with somatic ativity in the largest cancer dataset available, which consisted of 2,704 cancer samples from 39 different tumour types. Overall, ~46% of analyzed genomes have a least one L1 somatic retrotransposition event and we reported a total of 109 of germline L1 source loci with somatic retrotransposition activity in the cancer genome."  
**MSc. in Bioinformatics**, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain.  
:   *2015 – 2016*

[TFG]:##"Some plants are exposed to a combination of stressful environmental conditions, such as high temperatures during summer. The distribution of the strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) is predominantly Mediterranean, however, it is also found on the European Atlantic coast reaching Irish latitudes. In this degree thesis, we measured the photosynthetic yield and spectral properties of A. unedo leaves from 12 locations to study the photosynthesis inactivation and infer the adaptive capacity of this species to potential future warmer conditions. As shown in previous studies, the variability in the level of inactivation of photosynthesis of the geographical different trees was very low suggesting a homogeneous genetic structure. The physiological response profile to the effects of temperature showed a clear inactivating effector on photosystem II but also the existence of a protective effect associated with thermal stress."  
**BSc. in Biology**, Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, Spain.
