I love science but truly believe in work/play balance and thatâ€™s what I try hard to achieve. I also love travelling everywhere and anywhere and, in fact, I have visited more countries than years old I am. As I cannot be travelling all the time, I enjoy watching series or hiking with my friends and my dog Murphy during my spare time. I am both a mountain and sea soul.  

**Personal interests:** `Photography` - `Travelling` - `Movies` - `Tea` - `Graphical Design` - `Surf & Dive` - `Music` - `Science` - `Cultural Exchange` - `Nature` - `Gastronomy` -  `Hiking`  

As we are living at a time when environmental (climate change, species extinction, deforestation...) and social issues (poverty, inequality...) are on the agenda every day, I often volunteer in NGOs trying to help change and let those who will come a better world.
