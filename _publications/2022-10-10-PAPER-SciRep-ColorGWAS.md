**About the paper:**  
<!---In this study, a high-density genetic map was applied to ascertain the genetic basis of color variation in cockle shells. A major QTL on chromosome 13 was found to be associated with different color traits. This was a collaboration during my research as a PhD student.--->  

**Scope:** We constructed the first high-density genetic map of the common cockle, a species with significant shell colour variation across populations. It consisted of 19 linkage groups and through genome-wide association studies, a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 13 was associated with colour traits, and several candidate genes were identified in that region. Importantly, we found that this QTL overlaps with a genomic region previously linked to divergent selection in cockle distribution, suggesting its potential role in adaptation.
**Impact:** This research improves our understanding of the genetic architecture underlying shell colour variation in the common cockle and sheds light on its evolutionary and ecological significance.
**My contribution:** I was involved in sampling and the bioinformatic analysis of gene mining.
