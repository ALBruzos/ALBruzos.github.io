Here we identify a new mutational mechanism in cancer by with aberrant integration of L1 elements promote chromosomal rearrangements such as Megabase-size genomic deletions that on occasion remove tumour suppressor genes, contributing to cancer progression. *I catalogued the retrotransposition events of LINE-1.*
