**About the paper:**  
**Scope:** We studied the role of keratinocyte cholesterol metabolism in hyperproliferative inflammatory skin diseases in 28 patients, including rare monogenic disorders and common conditions like psoriasis. We hypothesize that disrupted cholesterol pathways in keratinocytes constitute a final common, druggable mechanism underlying these diseases.  
**Findings/Impact:** We showed that patient-derived keratinocytes consistently exhibit reduced cholesterol levels and increased proliferation, which is reversed by treatment with topical cholesterol and statin. Genetic analyses revealed enrichment of lipid metabolism gene variants in psoriasis, supporting a broader therapeutic potential for targeting cholesterol pathways in HISDs.  
**My contribution:** I was involved in the bioinformatic analysis of RNA-Seq data. 
**Personal importance:** This publication was part of a collaboration of my postdoc in the United Kingdom.
