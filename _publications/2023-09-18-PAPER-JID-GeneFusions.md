**About the paper:**  
Here, we studied a subset of 169 children with multiple congenital melanocytic naevi (CMN), that were wild-type for NRAS/BRAF mutations. We revealed and validated recurrent mosaic BRAF fusions and RAF1 fusions that involved the loss of the 5’ regulatory domain of BRAF/RAF1 but preserved the kinase domain. Due to the relation with MAPK hyperactivation, trametinib was tested in vitro and in two patients showing promising results. I was involved in the bioinformatic analysis of mosaic gene fusions during my postdoc in the United Kingdom, this publication does not include my PhD supervisor.
