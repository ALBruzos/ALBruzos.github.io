The flagship of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes Consortium that describes the main scientific findings from the analyses of ~3,000 cancer whole genomes and their matched normal tissues across 38 tumour types. I did bioinformatic analysis during my Master Thesis that ended up being one of the figures of this paper.
