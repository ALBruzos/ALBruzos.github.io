**About the paper:**  
<!---Here, we studied a subset of 169 children with multiple congenital melanocytic naevi (CMN), that were wild-type for NRAS/BRAF mutations. We revealed and validated recurrent mosaic BRAF fusions and RAF1 fusions that involved the loss of the 5’ regulatory domain of BRAF/RAF1 but preserved the kinase domain. Due to the relation with MAPK hyperactivation, trametinib was tested in vitro and in two patients showing promising results. I was involved in the bioinformatic analysis of mosaic gene fusions during my postdoc in the United Kingdom, this publication does not include my PhD supervisor.--->

**Scope:** We studied a subset of 169 children with multiple congenital melanocytic naevi (CMN), that were wild-type for NRAS/BRAF mutations. We revealed and validated recurrent mosaic BRAF fusions and RAF1 fusions that involved the loss of the 5’ regulatory domain of BRAF/RAF1 but preserved the kinase domain. Due to the relation with MAPK hyperactivation, trametinib was tested in vitro and in two patients showing promising results. 
**Impact:** Previously known recurrent causes of CMN are mosaic heterozygous missense pathogenic variants in NRAS (68% cases) and BRAF (7% cases) with 25% of patients with an unknown cause. This research reveals recurrent mosaic gene fusions as a mechanism and identifies trametinib as a promising treatment option. 
**My contribution:** I was involved in the bioinformatic analysis of mosaic gene fusions. 
**Personal importance:** This first-author publication of my postdoc in the United Kingdom marks my independence from my thesis supervisor's guidance.
