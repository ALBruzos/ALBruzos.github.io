**About the paper:**  
Here, we identify and characterize a remarkable mutational mechanism in human hepatocellular carcinoma caused by Hepatitis B virus, by which DNA molecules from the virus are inserted into the tumour genome causing dramatic changes in its configuration, including non-homologous chromosomal fusions and megabase-size telomeric deletions. *I participated in the wet-lab validation of the mechanism.*
